# Installing R and RStudio

The instructions below guide you on how to install R and RStudio. But first, what is the differnece betwen both?

R is a programming language we will be using to write code. For the computer to process and execute the commands we give in the R language, we need to install a specific version of R, in this case, R 4.3. Think of it like teaching your computer a new language; once R 4.3 is installed, your computer becomes fluent in that version of R and can understand the instructions you write in that language.

RStudio is a handy tool made especially for R, a programming language we use for stats and visualizing data. In RStudio, you can write and run R code more easily. Imagine R is the brain doing all the math, and RStudio is the friendly environment you use to instruct this brain, give it tasks, and see the results.
